#-server                                                Run in server mode, which takes longer to start but runs faster
#-XX:+UseParallelOldGC                  Use high throughput parallel GC on old generation
#-XX:+DisableExplicitGC                 Prevent direct calls to garbage collection in the code
#-XX:+UseAdaptiveGCBoundary             Allow young/old boundary to move
#-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit                Limit the amount of time that Java will stay in Garbage Collection before throwing an out of memory exception
#-XX:SurvivorRatio=16                   Shrink eden slightly (Normal is 25)
#-Xnoclassgc                                    Disable collection of class objects
#-XX:ParallelGCThreads=3                Maximum number of Parallel garbage collection tasks
